            Concept Visualiser
        </h2>
        
        The Concept Visualiser window consists of three main parts. A system menu, a visualisation pane and a console. The system menu has a fixed height. The visualisation pane and the console resides in a split pane with a shared height, where the proportions can be adjusted interactively. The overall proportions of the split pane depends on the size and scale of the browser window. When the browser window is resized the tree parts of the Concept Visualiser are resized accoringly and as a group. 
        
        <h3>
            &bull; System Menu
        </h3>
            The System menu currently contains an input field for chosing data input and buttons for showing and hiding the visualisation windows residing in the Visualisation Pane. The System Menu can be collapsed to gain more space for the Visualisation Pane.
        
        <h3>
            &bull; Visualisation Pane 
        </h3>
        The Visualisation Pane is the area where the visualisation sub-windows are residing/floating. Each sub-window can be draged, resized, collapsed, hidden and brought forward. Currently the maximal size of a sub-window is set to depend on the max size of the undelying svg element. Sub-windows are not resized when the browser window is resized but proportionally rescaled when the browser content window is zoomed in/out.
        
        <h3>
            &bull; Console
        </h3>
            The Console is the area where textual output from interacting with visualisations gets printed. The Console is not to be confused with the JavaScript or browser console. The Console can be collapsed to gain more space for the Visualisation Pane.
