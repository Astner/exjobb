/** Recurrence measures on standard format for recurrent concept derivation.
*
* Each recurrence measure takes at least three arguments (used as interface from other
* functions): the number of times the concept
* has occurred with a certain number of repetitions, the number of examples the concept
* has occurred in at all, the total number of examples in the data set, and, depending on the
* measure, 0 or more parameters. These parameters are typically bound, passing the resulting
* expression on standard format.
