/** ==<i>Concepts - Higher-order concept discovery for Spark/Scala</i>==
  *
  * ==Background==
  *
  * Concepts is a library for object correlation, similarity, and higher-order
  * concept discovery in very large data sets.
  * It aims at being a straightforward, easy-to-use and complete solution for
  * <ul>
  * <li>Calculation of pairwise concept correlations using a number of correlation measures
  * <li>Perform efficient transformation from a correlation- to a similarity graph
  * <li>Perform different types of graph-clustering for higher order concept discovery
  * <li>Efficiently perform hierarchical discovery of both recurrent, AND and OR concepts
  * </ul>
  * <p>
  * <ul>
  * The implementation aims to be
  * <li>Fully scalable both in terms of input data, concepts, and discovered higher order concepts
  * <li>Fully modular in terms of correlation measures, similarity measures, clustering algorithms etc.
  * <li>Lightweight, based on a functional codebase where core functions have no side effects
  * <li>Potentially portable to other compute engines such as Flink
  * </ul>
  *
  * ==Basic concepts==
  *
  * The library relies on a few basic assumptions:
  * <ul>
  * <li>Representations (data sets, clusters, higher-order concepts etc.) are
  *     stored and exchanged as Spark RDDs to allow for scaling.
  * <li>All concepts, both basic (e.g. words, songs, codons, events) and higher-order,
  * are identified by a unique <i>concept ID</i> represented by a `Long` value.
  * <li>In all core library functions, data is represented by <i>(index, conceptID)</i> pairs
  *     indicating that <i>conceptID</i> occurred at example <i>index</i> in data.
  *     Just like the <i>conceptID</i>, the <i>index</i> is represented by a `Long`.
  *     Typical functionality for converting to- and from this data format can be found in
  *     [[se.sics.concepts.util]] and [[se.sics.concepts.main]].
  * <li>Clusters and higher-order concepts are represented as collections of the constituent
  *     concept IDs.
  * </ul>
  *
  * ==Library structure==
  *
  * The library is organised around a number of packages that can be included as necessary.
  *
  * <b>Graphs</b><p>
  * The [[se.sics.concepts.graphs]] package contains core graph related functionality for the library.
  *
  * <b>Higherorder</b><p>
  * The [[se.sics.concepts.higherorder]] package contains functionality for deriving and
  * utilizing higher order concepts.
  *
  * <b>Utilities</b><p>
  * The [[se.sics.concepts.util]] package contains commonly used utility functions for transforming data,
  * graphs etc.
  *
  * <b>IO</b><p>
  * The [[se.sics.concepts.io]] package contains commonly used io functions for reading and writing data,
  * graphs etc. on different formats.
  *
  * <b>Main</b><p>
  * The [[se.sics.concepts.main]] package contains test, evaluation, and related utility functions for the
  * library.
  *
  * <b>Measures</b><p>
  * The [[se.sics.concepts.measures]] package contains measures on standard format for
  * correlation graph derivation and package recurrence significance.
  *
  * <b>Clustering</b><p>
  * The [[se.sics.concepts.clustering]] package contains graph clustering functions on standard format for higher-order
  * concept discovery.
  *
  * <b>Classification</b><p>
  * The [[se.sics.concepts.classification]] package contains classification functions and classes for concept contexts.
